The fully automated CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions with a self-hosted runner on the VM to build, push Docker images, and redeploy the app using Kubernetes Deployments, Services, and NGINX Ingress. I configured systemd services for auto-start of Minikube and the Cloudflare Tunnel, gaining hands-on experience with Kubernetes orchestration, Cloudflareâ€™s Zero Trust tunneling, self-hosted runners, and production-grade automation and DNS management.",
